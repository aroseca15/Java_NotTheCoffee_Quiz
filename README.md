# Java_NotTheCoffee_Quiz
Before I started this assignment I had a clear picture in my mind of what I wanted to do. For example, changing colors when the answer was "correct" or "incorrect". Or keeping score using one html page. To do that I used information from Web Dev Simplified(WDS) on youtube to give me the spring board I needed. 

I also worked with my tutors to create and check my javascript. This was extremely fustrating!! Everyone has their own way of doing it and the make me rewrite everything. Worse than that it made all of my previous work null! 

I don't understand why I could just build on the code I had and what I wanted it to do.
