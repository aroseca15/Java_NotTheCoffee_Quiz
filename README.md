# Java_NotTheCoffee_Quiz
Before I started this assignment I had a clear picture in my mind of what I wanted to do. For example, changing colors when the answer was "correct" or "incorrect". Or keeping score using one html page. To do that I used information from Web Dev Simplified(WDS) and Michael Dane (MD) on youtube to give me the spring board I needed. 

I also worked with my tutors to create and check my javascript.
